<h2>What to Know</h2>
  <p>There's endless resources out there for getting started drawing digitally. From YouTube to tutorials to lifestyle blogs, if you ever have a question about a specific effect or tool, all you need to do is Google it. Here's a few things to get you started.</p>
  <p><strong>Devices</strong></p>
  I use an iPad for my drawing, but that is by no means a required purchase. I like my iPad because it provides a larger surface area and the ability to use a stylus. Plus, there are a lot of digital drawing apps for iPads, since they are used by a lot of designers. But you could also use your phone to start. The screen will be smaller, but your phone will also be compatible with a lot of the drawing apps. Your laptop or desktop computer is also an option. Chances are, the free apps you're looking for may not be available on an actual computer as they're meant for mobile devices, but there are a lot of software options out there, if you're looking to use what you already have and not purchase another device.
  <p><strong>Tools</strong></p>
  <p>After obtaining a device to draw on, you'll likely need a stylus of some kind â€” or not. The wonderful thing about digital drawing is it can even be done on your phone just using your finnger. However, if you want the device to recognize different pressures and display a more precise brushstroke, then you might want to consider a stylus. They can range in price depending on what you're looking for. <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/" The the Apple pencil> is the top of the line and has the most capabilities (assuming you use Apple products. It's also the most expensive. Depending on the model you need, it will be at least over $100. The stylus I have was around $10, and there are a lot of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=stylus&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"similar options on Amazon>. Another option is <a href="https://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-tablets" a Wacom tablet>. This is a tablet with an attahed stylus that you connect to your computer. As you draw on the tablet, it will display on your computer.)
  <p><strong>Apps</strong></p>
There are a lot of applications available for drawing digitally, and it all comes down to artist preference. A couple free ones that I love are Adobe Illustrator Draw and Adobe Fresco. Draw is a more basic version of Adobe Illustrator, while Fresco has more textures, brushes, and effects. The apps themselves are free but so require an Adobe plan and account. If you're using a computer, Adobe Illustrator is a great place to start vector drawing. Another app that a lot of designers use <a href="https://procreate.art/"is called Procreate>. I like to think of it as an app just for illustrators and graphic designers. It has a lot of brush and effect options, and it's just under $10 for a one-time purpose, which is helpful if you don't want to pay for a monthly subscription.
