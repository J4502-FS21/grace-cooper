<h2>Add Color & Texture</h2>
  <p>Now, you're at the last and most exciting step of the drawing process: adding color and texture to your digital drawing!</p>
  <p><strong>Experiment with Brushes</strong></p>
  <p>We've already talked a little about brushes, but there really is a lot you can do. With some apps you can even buy and import new brushes that a creator has made to get an even more specialized version of what you want. There's brushes mimicking paint, pen, pencil, and even ones that just leave behind patterns. Adding different layers over your traced picture can help you experiment with different brushes, without worrying about messing up the intiial drawing, until you find what you want.</p>
  <p><strong>Pick the Perfect Color</strong></p>
  <p>If you have a specific color in mind, you can choose it from a color wheel or pre-created palettes in the app. There's also an eyedropper tool in most apps that will allow you to pull the exact colors from the original picture or from a color palette that you import as an image.</p>
  <p><strong>Export and Share Your Picture</strong></p>
<p>Finally, it's time to share your image with the world! Or maybe just keep for yourself, which is ok too. There's usually an option to export your image as different file sizes and types from the app. Illustrator Draw and Adobe Fresco are very convenient because they can add files to your Adobe library, so you can share them across devices easily.</p>
