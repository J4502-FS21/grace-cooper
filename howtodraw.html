<h2>How to Draw</h2>
<img src="pittsburghdrawing.png" alt="Colorful drawing of the downtown Pittsburgh skyline from across a river">
  <p>The actual mechanics of getting started drawing are pretty simple. Just open a new project on your selected app and get started. But I have a few beginner tips that might help you out, if your're not ready to draw free hand yet.</p>
<p><strong>Select a Photo</strong></p>
<p>It's no secrect: A lot of artists trace their drawings. If you're not used to drawing, then it's a good way to get started. And even if you are, it can be a fun, therapeutic to make a beautiful picture even more interesting. When I got started, I liked to use more basic photos of buildings, rather than people. But start where you feel most comfortable and try it out!</p>
<p><strong>Add Layers</strong></p>
<p>Once you import your photo into your selcted app, create a new layer for you to draw over the photo. Layers are important because instead of changed the actual image, you'll be changing a different layer just meant for your drawing. You can always undo anything you want or even start from scratch on a new layer. Every application is different, but most meant for graphic design will have layers and a way to adjust translucency. I find it easier to make the underlying image slightly lighter, whether by adjusting the transcluceny or adding a film of white over the top, so that I can see my brushstrokes more clearly and not focus just on what's in the background.
<p><strong>Choose a Brush</strong></p>
<p>These apps are especially good at mimicking real paint brushes, pens, etc., whether you're looking for a runny watercolor or precise pen. I usually start with a simple brush for tracing and then switch to a brush with a little more flourish when I'm adding color. But try to find what suits you and what you find the easiest. Depending on the app, you can also adjust the brush's thickness and it's ability to smooth curves when you draw. And now you're ready to begin tracing!</p>
